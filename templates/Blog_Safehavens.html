		<h3 class="heads" id="introPara">In today’s article, we're going to briefly go through several categories of safe-haven investments and compare their performance from Wednesday February 19th to Monday March 23rd of this year to that of the S&P500 over that same time period which we'll use to represent the stock market as a whole. </h3>
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='./Images/safehaven.jpg') }}" class="MainIMG">
		<p class="para">Obviously this is a very narrow time frame not to mention an incredibly unique recession, so let's be sure not to extrapolate this simple analysis to claim that these assets are bad investments, or that this even proves that they aren't safe havens, but one would expect that these investments would have insulated investors from the rapid 34% drop we saw in March, otherwise their downside protection may be blown out of proportion.</p>
		<p class="para">The first traditional safe haven we’ll look at is the government bond or more specifically the US Treasury bond. The U.S. is viewed as the strongest economy in the world, so lending your money to the government is viewed as a safe haven investment because there's a high probability you'll get your money back. In fact, in financial theory treasury bonds are considered risk-free because theoretically if the US government didn't have the money they needed to pay you back they could simply print more cash or tax their people to meet their obligations. Now obviously this would not go without severe ramifications and the independence of the Federal Reserve would make this strategy very difficult for the government to carry out but regardless, the Treasury bill and bond are considered safe holdings for investors during times of turmoil, and indeed if you look at their most recent performance during this recent crash, Treasuries do appear to have held their own. if you look at the Vanguard Treasury bond ETF for short-term, intermediate and long-term bonds you can see they all increase by varying degrees during the crash with longer-term bonds performing the best. However, there are some important factors to consider here. First of all, Treasury bonds see their prices rise when interest rates fall, and during the specific time series the US Federal Reserve carried out a material rate cut that brought the federal funds rate effectively to 0%, so it's unclear how much of this price return is attributable to market uncertainty versus this rate cut.</p>
		<p class="para">Next up we have gold, which is really the poster boy of safe havens. Many people place their money in gold believing that it not only isolates them from falling profits in the market but also from the deteriorating value of currencies, but how did the precious metal perform during this recent bear market? Well compared to stocks it didn't do too poorly, but it was far from a perfect head. Gold prices on the COMEX future market fell by 2% over the timeframe analysed. Now obviously falling 2 percent is a lot better than falling 30 percent, and the metal did actually recover right after the crash, not to mention it jumped as record jobless claims were reported, so this doesn't really prove that the metal doesn't provide any protection in a recession. Furthermore, in 2008 the price of gold did actually appreciate as stock prices fell, so in the past it has acted more as a safe haven during longer decline spanning financial crisis, but during the recent market crash gold fell with stocks and only recovered when stocks were exiting their initial downturn so perhaps in this particular sort of downturn gold isn’t really effective as a safe haven, but given its small decline it still scores fairly well for preserving capital. </p>
		<p class="para">Finally let's talk about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has long been argued to be a form of safe haven because like gold it has a finite supply meaning it isn't subject to interference from central banks like currency is. The thing is, we haven't really been able to test how Bitcoin would perform during a bear market until now, and well honestly, just like stocks Bitcoin felt quite a bit over the timeframe analysed, seeing a drop of 29.5%.  So, when it comes to market crashes, Bitcoin doesn't really seem to offer any downside protection, and while Bitcoin was argued to be gold 2.0, the OG seems to have protected its throne in the Covid-19 downturn. </p>
		<p class="para">So those are how safe havens have performed during this year's market crash. Of course this is by no means a comprehensive or even statistically significant analysis, but the point I'm trying to make here is that there's no silver bullet for avoiding these market crashes. Treasuries were really the only investment that performed better than you would have done just holding cash, and even there we saw a huge interest rate cut feeding that return. In the end, market crashes are just part of what we signed up for when we invest in stocks; after all risk is the counterpart to return and that doesn't mean we should take on unnecessary risk or ignore red flags, but it does mean that in order to achieve return over time, we're going to occasionally see volatility. It sucks but rather than trying to time the market or try to predict the uncontrollable factors, focus on what you can control and take on risk that's appropriate to your risk tolerance. Many investment professionals also recommend that investors diversify to reduce risk between both stocks and across other asset classes including some of the ones we've discussed.</p>
