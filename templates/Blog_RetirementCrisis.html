		<h3 class="heads" id="introPara">With ageing populations and declining birth rates, we may see a future in most advanced economies where the quality of life for the elderly rapidly declines or where young people are taxed very heavily to support them, neither of which is appealing to anyone, so radical solutions may be what we need.</h3>
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='./Images/retirementCrisis.jpg') }}" class="MainIMG">
		<p class="para">A future where the dependent elderly far outweigh the productive young is fast approaching and current pension infrastructure may not be able to cope. When schemes like government pensions were originally put into place in more developed nations (late 1800s to early 1900s) life expectancies were lower than the age of retirement. Furthermore, life expectancy back then was drastically influenced by wealth as richer people had access to better food, healthcare and a healthy work and home environment. This meant that of the few who did grow old enough to receive a pension, most of them would have been too wealthy to qualify. Even today, studies have found that the biggest determining factor between life expectancy inside the nation is income. This is to say that as people around the world are getting richer and richer, they are also getting older and older. Life expectancies today hover around 80 years old where most pensions kick in between 60-65 years old. This means that on average the state is having to look after people financially for 15 years or more, which ultimately is not sustainable. This is all an expensive program. In the US, pensions for public servants have become a $3.5 trillion unfunded liability.</p>
		<p class="para">Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager of Pershing Square Capital, has started advocating a retirement plan called “Birthright” that would give every American a few thousand dollars (around $6750) upon birth which they can only access at the age of retirement (roughly 65 years old). This sum would vary for other nations depending on their costs of living. This money would then be invested in a diverse portfolio of assets which would generate returns of about 8% annually based on historical trends. This would mean that everyone would have a comfortable nest egg by the age of retirement.</p>
        <p class="para">Key advantages to this scheme include it covering people who wouldn’t be in a financial position to contribute to their own retirement savings, and this is a lot cheaper than current retirement plans. Based on the number of newborns in the USA in 2019 this scheme would cost around $150 billion which is far less than the hundreds of billions attributed to old age welfare by the government today. It shifts the revenue burden from the taxpayer to the financial markets. $6,800 at birth given current market rates of return would give people $1.2 million at a retirement age of 65. Hypothetically, if this was instead raised to a gift at birth of $30,000 which is the average pension for most developed nations, then people would retire with a nest egg of $5.3 million which will be equivalent to $1.47 million 2020 dollars. It would be achieving this while still being on average 15 times cheaper to implement in the long run.</p>
        <p class="para">Of course this still doesn’t address the issue of an ageing population that will still be a burden on society. However, through capital investment, if people put enough money into machinery and technology that it lets people in the labour force do the work of two or more men, then the person that contributed that machinery or technology can effectively retire without the economy losing any productive output.</p>
        <p class="para">So far, this strategy is cheaper for the taxpayer, more beneficial for recipients and better for citizen morale all while contributing money to local companies to create more wealth for shareholders which happen to be the citizens of the nation.</p>
        <p class="para">On the other hand, there are some major problems with this strategy.</p>
        <p class="para">One problem is that it is expensive. Yes, while long term it works out cheaper than pensions through taxpayers, there would be a significant upfront cost. Assuming this program only gives money to newborns after the commencement date, there would be an entire 65 year period where the government would need to pay for regular pensions as well as this new scheme. For people entering the workforce today would likely have to pay for this over their entire working careers, retire and die before they ever see someone fund their own retirement through this scheme. This could be written down as making sacrifices for future generations, but the climate crisis has shown we aren’t great at that either.</p>
        <p class="para">Another issue with this scheme is that it puts too much faith in markets and people. While historically an 8% market return has been observed, these returns aren’t perfectly consistent and if someone retires in a year like 2008 or early 2020 they might find that their portfolio is worth half of what they were expecting. Additionally, past performance is not an indication of future growth for the markets, so this 8% magic number is likely an overestimate. This would mean that the initial payment would need to be larger or people would need to retire later.</p>
        <p class="para">Also, people are highly likely to burn through all of this money suddenly given to them. Money is very easy to spend and recipients of major windfalls like this more often than not file for bankruptcy. If we then put them back on a pension, it would encourage people to blow off all this money.</p>
        <p class="para">One final criticism is that this would just cause inflation, if everyone in the world became a millionaire the day they turned 65 then being a millionaire wouldn’t be special anymore. The cost of housing and consumer goods would just rise to meet this new demand. However, that may not be the case to the extent that you might think. Inflation is caused when more money is in circulation for less goods available, but these people have become rich because they have invested in public companies over a long period of time not because it was printed out of thin air. With more investment, these companies can make products and balance out this extra cash in circulation with extra goods in circulation.</p>
        <p class="para">Finally, what does Ackman benefit from spending so much of his valuable time pushing this agenda? Well, if the government were to adopt a predictable large scale stock purchase then he, as a hedge fund manager, would profit greatly from this, making him far richer than any of those retirees.</p>
