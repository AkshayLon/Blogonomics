		<h3 class="heads" id="introPara">The importance of Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) in the UK economy and their role in the health of the economy is a topic that is not without some controversy. There is a belief among some economists that a healthy, vigorous small business sector is vital to the performance of the UK economy.</h3>
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='./Images/businessDesk.jpg') }}" class="MainIMG">
		<p class="para">The UK has a smaller firm sector (the UK’s current industrial structure is still dominated by the large firm sector) than countries such as Germany and Japan, who have enjoyed better economic performance and growth. Germany has a more important SME sector than the UK, and its new firm start-ups are likely to be of higher quality than new firm start-ups in the UK.</p>
		<p class="para">Before we get to the good stuff, what exactly defines a small firm? The Bolton Report in 1971 gives three essential characteristics of a small firm:<ul class="bullets"><li>It has a small share of the market</li><li>It is managed by its owners or part-owners in a personalised way</li><li>It is operated independently</li></ul></p>
		<p class="para">The third definition can be referred to as an economic definition, as it can be incompatible with some small firms which may have a formal management structure and do not necessarily have a small share in the market.</p>
		<p class="para">Now that we understand what a small firm is, let us delve into the importance of the small firm sector in the UK. The increase of the growth in the number of small firms has remained static over the last few decades, however, the number of micro firms (employs less than 10 people) has been increasing strongly. Therefore, most of the growth in the importance of small firms have come from these micro-businesses. The reasons for the concentration of growth in micro firms are unclear, however, some believe that these reasons may be associated with the restructuring of the economy back in the 1980s when large numbers of workers were made redundant. The official jobless total peaked at 3,070,621 in 1982 and the main factors behind this huge rise in the jobless total were the economic recession the UK economy was going through, and of course, the restructuring of the industry as many traditional manufacturing industries went into closure.</p>
		<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='./Images/laptop.jpg') }}" class="MainIMG">
		<p class="para">Due to the lack of opportunity, quite a few people who had lost their jobs were tempted into starting their own micro-businesses. However, the explanation of the growth of these micro firms is more complex than simple push factors from high unemployment rates and is probably tied to underlying structural changes in the economy. The Bolton Report put forward the following reasons:<ul class="bullets"><li>Structural changes in the UK economy, particularly the decline in manufacturing and the growth of the service sector, meant that a smaller size of firm was more ‘optimal’.</li><li>An associated change in the extent of economies of scale, partly associated with technological changes, suited smaller-scale production, which benefited small firms.</li><li>The small firm had the ability to be more flexible and respond to ‘market opportunities’ and had the ability to be both specialised and flexible.</li><li>Small firms benefited from changes in government policy which fostered so-called ‘enterprise culture’.</li><li>Changes in the macro-economic policy favoured small firms and changes in corporation tax rules ensured a fairer treatment of small firms.</li><li>Introduction of private sector initiatives such as establishing enterprise agencies with sponsorship from the private sector.</li><li>The small firm played a more important role in local authority policy (e.g. some economic development units launched initiatives to help smaller firms).</li><li>High unemployment rates which occurred several times these past few decades in the UK forced some workers to start their own enterprise using their existing skills funded by their redundancy payments, rather than retraining.</li></ul></p>
		<p class="para">Many of these small firms either go on to live and make decent turnovers or die and cease to exist. Lots of firms struggle to survive in business, and many micro-firms spend much of their time trying to survive day-to-day, which means there is little to no forward planning, which explains the very small turnover levels generated.</p>
		<p class="para">Conclusively, there has come a gradual realisation that high small and micro firms birth rates are not as impressive as they seem, because many of these new start-ups do not survive beyond the first year of operation. Rather, we should be more concerned about the quality of new small firm start-ups, because this is the factor that determines job creation, which helps the UK economy grow, although there is controversy surrounding the role of small firms in creating employment, as it takes a lot of small firms to create the same number of jobs as a larger firm.</p>
